	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p> The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity</p>
   <p><b>Space complexity </b>is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space.</p>
