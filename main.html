    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms are crucial for handling large-scale data processing, as they ensure timely execution.</p>
    <p>When dealing with algorithms, Space Complexity is a vital consideration. It represents the amount of memory space required by an algorithm during its lifecycle. In Big O notation, it's often denoted as O(n). <b>Space Complexity</b> analysis helps in optimizing memory usage and preventing any potential issues related to memory overflow.</p>
